How to compile:
    Run the 'make' command. If this fails with issues about the bin and
    bin/data_flow folders not existing, then those folders will need to be
    manually created. Otherwise, the makefile will attempt to automatically
    create them.

Notable/clever things:
    Run 'make clean ; make debug' to generate a DOT graph of the original CFG.
    I updated the dot output to use subgraph clusters in order to debug some
    issues where I had multiple functions and the numbering for the basic blocks
    in the graph were the same.
